Project Zomboid Mod, open for community improvements!

Dressed for the Job
Tired of the doctor treating your wounds wearing their bloodstained armor and gross welding mask? Ever wanted to have a reason to dress for the occasion? WELL NOW YOU DO!

THIS MOD ADDS
When you wear the clothing appropriate for the skill you are gaining, you will gain extra xp!
This mod is ready to add extra clothing patches! You just need to create a patch mod. See the discussion section!

TRANSLATIONS
This mod is ready to be translated, if anyone is interested. The language files should be ready to go.

SANDBOX OPTIONS
You can set how much xp someone dressed in the right costuming will gain! (0% to 1000% defaults at 100%)
You can set how many pieces of appropriate clothing you need to wear! (1 to 6 defaults at 3)

FAQ:
Is this multiplayer ready?
Yep!

ROADMAP: FUTURE PLANS
Add more clothes. Both mine, and compatibility patches for popular mods.
I have already added support for offhand held items. This will be released on Saturday.
